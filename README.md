Are you sick of the discussion culture on social networks like Twitter or Facebook but you really like to talk about things?
Counting "thumbs up" or following useless troll comments on posts and tweets is not what you call a usefull discussion?

You really want to discuss the current political situation, seriously. Face to face.
Or a specific book you just read.
Or a scientific topic.
Maybe you want to share some thoughts on a certain hobby.
Or you want some feedback on a new idea you have.

Use dscss.online (pronounce "discuss online") to find and attend live discussions (audio and/or video) on all kinds of topics.

You can't find a proper discussion for your topic?
No problem. Just announce a new discussion and invite other "birds of a feather" to join.
Or ask for attendees with different opinions to start a vibrant discussion on your topic.

Invite experts or famous people to your discussion to get the most out of it.

Let others listen to your discussion and spread the word on other social networks to increase your audience.
